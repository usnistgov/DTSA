The backscattercoefficient is that of Love and Scott; the stopping power S isthat of Pouchou; the cross-section is that of Fabre; and the energydistribution of backscattered electrons is that of Czyzewski.The absorption correction uses Heinrich's mass absorption coefficientsand also his expression for f(chi). The characteristic fluorescencecorrection is Reed's. There is no continuum fluorescence correction.<P>The ZAF quantitation procedure is run on a WORK spectrum filein conjunction with either the MLLSQ or Simplex fitting procedure.The ZAF quantitation is run in two parts: first is the calculationof the standards and the creation of files of standards data,and second is the calculation of the compositions of unknowns.These two operations are executed by selection from the DTSA ZAFsub-menu. We will first describe the selections related to  standards.<P>ZAF Standards files <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/zaf_menu.gif HEIGHT=119 Width=420> <P>    The first two menu items are for creating, appending, anddisplaying files of standards used in the &quot;quantitative&quot;procedures that convert peak intensities obtained from the curvefitting procedures into chemical compositions. ZAF Stds Flowchartgives detailed information on how to make a ZAF Standard. Moreinformation is provided in the section on ZAF quantitation.<BR><P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="MZ">Make ZAF Standards</A ></H3><P>The first step in the ZAF matrix correction procedure is to setup the standards that will be needed for the analysis. This isthe laborious part of the analysis procedure. However, in manycases ZAF standards may be reused for other ZAF analyses providedthe analysis conditions are the same (e.g., the beam voltage,the x-ray line for the element being analyzed, and the fittingprocedure used to obtain the peak areas). The spectrum acquisitiontime (Live Time) and the beam current (Faraday Current) must beentered in the Spectrum Header since the data are normalized usingthese parameters. If no Faraday Current is entered, the programassumes that it is 1 nA. The steps required to make a ZAF standardare as follows:<P>1. Read the spectrum from a standard material into the WORK SPECTRUM.<P>2. Under the &quot;Headers Menu&quot;, select &quot;ExperimentHeader&quot;. Make sure that the beam voltage and the detectorparameters are correct.<P>3. Then select &quot;Spectrum Header&quot;. Enter the Begin current,End current, and Acq. Time (live time). Also enter a label forthe ZAF standard as the first information in the spectrum Comments.This label should clearly differentiate the new ZAF standard fromothers you might have for the same element.<P>4. Select Composition Information in the Spectrum Header Window.Enter the elements present in the standard together with theircompositions; include elements that do not have x-ray lines inthe spectrum. Then click the radio button for Valences and enterthe valences for each element. These will be used to compute oxygencomposition if you select to compute oxygen by stoichiometry.Also see the chapter on <A HREF="Headers.html#HM"> Headers</a>.<P>5. Click the &quot;Specimen is a Standard&quot; box before leavingthis window.<P>6. Leave the Spectrum Header Window by attaching the header tothe WORK SPECTRUM (&quot;OK&quot; button). (You may make any changespermanent by editing the DTSA file - see chapter on Headers).<P>7. Now Set-up either the <A href="Main_Control.html#SI"> Simplex</a> or the <A href="Main_Control.html#MF"> Least Squares</a> fittingroutine and Do a Fit on the standard spectrum. ***NOTE***: Standardsand data must be fit by the same procedure.<P>8. Pull down the &quot;Analysis Menu&quot; and select &quot;MakeZAF Standards&quot; under &quot;DTSA ZAF&quot;. A dialog box willappear on the screen.<P>9. Select &quot;Run ZAF on Work Fit-Results&quot;. If everythingwas properly set up, a message box will appear displaying theanalysis conditions. If these are satisfactory, select the &quot;ItsOK&quot; button and the computations will be done with the resultsdisplayed in a window. If there are missing or incorrect datadetected by the program, a diagnostic message will appear describingwhat to do.<P>10. If everything is satisfactory and this is your first standardof the current session, you need to either open an old standardsfile or start a new standards file. Then select &quot;Add Standardto the file&quot;. For additional standards, it is not necessaryto open or start a new file if the standard is to be added tothe same file. Simply click &quot;Add Standard to the file&quot;after the &quot;Run ZAF on Work Fit-Results&quot; has been done.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/zaf_dia.gif HEIGHT=255 Width=362> <P>Standards may be added to any existing standards file or a newstandards file may be started. It is suggested that all of thestandards in any file have the same beam voltage, be measuredwith the same detector, and all be fitted with either the simplexor the least squares routine. This is not a requirement; however,this procedure is suggested to help the user keep track of theirstandards. All counting data used in the ZAF is computed as counts/second/nanoampereso spectra collected for different live times, for example, canstill be used together. The Faraday current is the average ofthe begin and end Faraday Currents entered in the Spectrum Header.If the Faraday Currents are not specified (zero), the programwill use 1.0 nanoampere.<P>This concludes the standards section of the ZAF procedure. Whilethe steps seem tedious, it should be remembered that standardsmay be reused for many analyses provided conditions are the same.<P>**NOTE** There is one situation that should be mentioned. If thespectrum has been fitted and then additional data must be enteredin either the experiment header or the spectrum header, the fitmust be repeated since these data are only updated into the ZAFprocedure after a fit has been done.<P> Show ZAF Stds  in the menu allows the user to examine the contentsof any ZAF standards file.  NOTE  DTSA Standards and CITZAF Standardsare identical so these files may be used for either method.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="SZ">Setup ZAF Analysis</A></H3><P>The set-up for processing unknowns is much simpler than that forstandards. The individual steps will be described below however,all that is required is to set up the fitting routine, selectthe appropriate standards for each element, and specify the calculationprocedure for an unanalyzed element if one is present. You mustset up the fitting procedure first and then the ZAF procedure.Nothing is actually computed until the fitting procedure is activated.Single spectra may be processed using &quot;Do a Fit&quot; oran entire DTSA file of spectra may be processed with the &quot;FitALL Work File Spectra&quot; button under the Analysis Menu.<P>The following steps are required to Set-up a ZAF quantitativeanalysis:<P>1. Read the spectrum of the unknown into the WORK SPECTRUM.<P>2. Be sure that the entries in the Experiment Header and the SpectrumHeader are satisfactory. If there are any elements of known compositionthat you do not wish to analyze, enter the Atomic Number and Compositionin the Compositions Window of the Spectrum Header.<P>3. Set-up either a Simplex or a Least Squares fitting routineaccording to the instructions for these routines. Do not do thefit yet.<P>4. Select &quot;Setup ZAF Analysis&quot; from &quot;DTSA ZAF&quot;under the Analysis Menu to begin setting up the ZAF procedure.<P>5. If a Set-up File has previously been created for this analysis,select the &quot;Use Set-up File&quot; button and open the appropriateSet-up file.<P>6. Otherwise, select the &quot;Set-up an Analysis&quot; button.This opens a dialog box for the selection of standards for theanalysis.<P>7. Select the &quot;Open Stds File&quot; button. A list of ZAFStandards Files appears in an open file dialog box. Select a file.<P>8. A scrolling list of Standards included in the file appearsin the dialog box of step 6. Select a Standard from the list.<P>9. A list of Elements and X-ray Lines in the selected Standardappears in a new dialog box with a checkbox for each Element.Select elements needed from this standard and select &quot;OK&quot;.<P>10. Repeat steps 7 and/or 8 and 9 until standards have been selectedfor all analyzed elements.<P>11. Select &quot;OK&quot;. A dialog box for selecting an &quot;UnanalyzedElement&quot; now appears. If all elements are analyzed, simplyselect &quot;OK&quot; from this dialog.<P>12. Otherwise, select the appropriate buttons for the unanalyzedelement. Any element may be done by difference however, only oxygenmay be done by stoichiometry. For a stoichiometry calculation,the valences for each element must have been entered in the SpectrumHeader (preferably in the standards file).<P>13. If you have any elements of known composition, the compositionsof those elements should have been entered in the Spectrum Header.Select &quot;Yes&quot; for using elements of FIXED composition.<P>14. This completes the Set-up. You may Save the Set-up for useagain before exiting this dialog.<P>15. The ZAF analysis will now be executed at the end of each fitto a spectrum.<P>16. The compositions will be included in the Analysis Resultsreport and in any spreadsheet that has been requested. In additiona ZAF Output report may also be written. This is a text documentcontaining all of the conditions and parameters of the ZAF computations.Select the &quot;Full ZAF Report File?&quot; button on the mainZAF window to bring up the open file dialog for this ASCII file.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/zaf_quant.gif HEIGHT=334 Width=597> <P>The spectrum in Work is normally processed, however, if a fileof fit results already exists, these results may be run throughZAF by selecting &quot;Old Fit File&quot; as the last step beforeexiting this dialog.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="CL">Cliff-Lorimer</A></H2><P>    The Cliff-Lorimer quantitation procedure is intended for thinmaterial specimens in which absorption is negligible. In Version2.0 all elements in a specimen are assumed to be analyzed by theprocedure. Cliff-Lorimer quantitation requires K factors whichare computed from elemental concentrations and peak intensitiesin spectra from standard materials. A DTSA K factor is the ratioof the concentration divided by peak intensity of an element inthe standard spectrum to the concentration divided by peak intensityof a selected element, the base element, in the same standardspectrum. The base element is commonly Fe or Si but may be anyelement common in your analytical problems. A set of DTSA K factorsare used to calculate the concentrations of the elements in aspecimen from the ratios of the element peak intensity to thepeak intensity of the base element in the specimen spectrum. <P>    To ensure internal consistency, DTSA K factors are calculatedonly from data obtained from Simplex or MLLSQ fitting results filesfor standards. DTSA K factors from spectra acquired with the samedetector and beam voltage and fit with the same  procedure canbe saved in a K factor file. These files can be appended at anytime, and K factors can be deleted from them. Saved K factorscan be used for any appropriate analysis.  The program checksthat the experimental conditions and fit procedure of K factorsselected for an analysis are correct for the spectrum file beinganalyzed. It also verifies that the lines used to calculate thechosen K factors are the same as those chosen for the analysisof the spectra using MLLSQ fitting, or are among the lines forSimplex fitting. If you are appending a K factor file and thestandard spectrum fit results file has no data for the base elementbut has an element with a saved K factor, K factors are calculatedfrom ratios to that element and the saved K factor. If a K factoris already in the file the user may choose to replace it withthe new value or with an average of the two values. If the standardfitting results file was made using 'Fit ALL Work File Spectra'DTSA will calculate the average value and standard deviation ofthe K factors for each selected element.<P>    You may use the <A HREF="Generate.html#GM"> spectrum generation</a> feature of DTSA to obtaina K factor for an element not available in a standard. If youcan generate a spectrum that matches an acquired standard spectrumthat has a family of lines for an element nearby in the periodictable, use the same generation parameters to generate a spectrumfor the missing element. Use the fit to this spectrum to makethe K factor.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/cl_menu.gif HEIGHT=160 Width=435><P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="MK">Make K Factors</A></H3><P>Selection of this sub-menu item displays the dialog for makingDTSA K factors. <P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/kfact_dia.gif HEIGHT=245 Width=385> <P>1.

This methodis not as accurate as the method using standards and should notbe used if standards are available. &quot;Standardless&quot; analysisis subject to substantial errors and the new user should readthe caveat to be found in <A href="APPENDIX.html#A2">Appendix II</a>.<P>To run a &quot;Standardless&quot; Analysis, simply select the&quot;Standardless&quot; ZAF button from the Analysis Menu aftersetting up a peak fitting routine. The open file dialog appearsallowing the user to save a ZAF Output file. The Unanalyzed Elementwindow appears allowing a selection of an unanalyzed element asin the analysis of unknowns by standards. Since this procedureautomatically normalizes the results to 100%, the only choiceallowed is for oxygen by stoichiometry.  All other informationis obtained from the Set-up of the fitting procedure.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="HB">HALL Bio Analysis</A></H2><P> The Hall-type analysis is a procedure for calculating concentrationsin thin biological or polymeric specimens. Some region of thebackground in the spectra can be selected to give a good measureof the mass thickness of the analytical volume. The average atomicnumber of the matrix in this volume is assumed to be known.  Thismeans that the element concentrations to be determined from thespectra do not contribute significantly to the average atomicnumber of the analytical volume. This situation is typically encounteredfor biological or polymeric materials for which the matrix ismostly carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and/or nitrogen and where theanalytes of interest are dilute concentrations of calcium, sulfur,etc. The ratios of peak areas to chosen background are used inthe calculation of concentrations. These ratios are obtained fromeither the MLLSQ or Simplex fitting procedure.  The Hall analysiscan be applied to a file of results produced by running the LinearLeast Squares or Simplex fitting procedure on an experiment fileof spectra, or it can be applied to an experiment file of spectraafter setting up a fitting procedure to obtain the required ratios. Standards are required for the Hall procedure: the factors thatconvert peak-to-background ratios to concentrations are calculatedfrom the fit results obtained from spectra from standards. Thespecimen spectra must be acquired with the same experimental conditionsand analyzed with the same fitting procedure as the standards. Fitting results from standards must be available for each elementto be analyzed, but they need not be in the same file.  Once obtained,a fit result for any element in a standard may be used in anyappropriate Hall analysis.  The chosen background value may becorrected for contributions due to the support film and a bulksource such as the support grid. If there is a bulk contributionto the spectra, the background should be selected in a peak freeregion of the spectrum but close to a characteristic line of thebulk element. A binary file of quantitative results is alwayssaved. It has the default name 'Hall_Results' unless the outputoption to name it is selected.  A short text version is displayedwhen the analysis is complete.  Spread sheet files and a fulltext file with the fit results and Hall information may be madefrom the binary file.  The Set-up for a Hall analysis may be savedand invoked to analyze either a fit result file or the Work Spectrumfile. Only the background correction information in the Set-upmay be changed.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="PH">Preparing for a  Hall Analysis</A></H3><P>1. To run the Hall analysis on a WORK Spectrum, set up a fittingprocedure that includes all the elements with characteristic linesin the spectrum, but do not contribute to the estimated averageatomic number of the matrix. The chosen background (Quant ROI)should be selected in the energy region least affected by bulkcontributions and free of characteristic lines. <P>a) If a correction for a bulk contribution to the background isrequired, include a line from the bulk source in the fitting.Choose a line near the Quant ROI. Either there must be a spectrumfrom the bulk source in the WORK file, or a fit result file availablefor a spectrum from the bulk source. Check that the spectrum classfor the bulk spectrum is 'bulk'.<P>b) If a correction for a support film is required, a spectrumfrom the film must be in the WORK file or in some other spectrumfile. Check that the spectrum class for the film spectrum is 'film'.<P>2. If running the Hall analysis on a file of fitting results,only the Hall analysis itself needs to be set up. <P>a) To do a  correction for a bulk contribution to the background,the bulk line in each spectrum must have a fit result in the fileto Hall analyze. Also, there must be a fit result for a spectrumfrom the bulk source in either the fit file to analyze or in someother fit file. Check that the class is 'bulk'. <P>b) If a correction for a support film is required, a fit resultfrom the film must be in the fit results file to Hall analyzeor there must be a film spectrum file. Check that the class is'film'.<P>3. Be sure there is a fit result from a standard for each elementto be analyzed.

Use this to continue a Qualon a file that has exceeded the limits imposed by option 1 above.<P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="CZ">CITZAF Quantitation</A></H2><P>Information on this item is provided in the Appendix. This allowsfor the running of John Armstrong's CITZAF program in a mannersimilar to the DTSA ZAF procedure. Standards are set up the sameway as for DTSA ZAF, in fact the standards files are exactly thesame and may be used for either method.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P><H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="MS">Manual Peak Stripping</A></H2><P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/Man_Pk_Strip.gif HEIGHT=480 Width=640><P>The Manual Peak Stripping feature is a qualitative tool usefulfor stripping peaks manually, by eye, from a spectrum to see ifother peaks from another element might be hiding underneath. <P>It is generally a good idea to use a Bi-Polar display and havethe spectrum expanded horizontally so that only the peak bundleyou are working with is visible on the screen. This will considerablyimprove the response time. <P>After preparing the spectrum, push Load and the following dialogwill appear:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/pkstrip_load.gif HEIGHT=335 Width=637><P> There are three choices controlled by the radio buttons. If thereference peak option is chosen, it is required that there bea valid file of references available to choose. This file of referencesis the same as used in <A href="Files.html#MR">MLLSQ</a>. AfterOK, the first dialog reappears and the process of stripping canbegin. Use the horizontal bar at the bottom left of the displayto control the amount to be stripped. Use the horizontal arrowicons to control the width of the stripped peak(s). Use the buttonsat the very bottom left of the display to control the energy ofthe stripped peak(s). <P>If the horizontal  (energy) position of the stripping peak(s)is different from the peak(s) being stripped then the result willlook like the following:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/strip1.gif HEIGHT=167 Width=201> <P>   If the width of the stripping peak(s) are different from thepeak(s) being stripped, then the result will look like:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/strip2.gif HEIGHT=161 Width=181> <P>   If the amount (height) of the stripping peak(s) are differentfrom the peak(s) being stripped, then the result will look likethe following:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/strip3.gif HEIGHT=146 Width=166> <P>   Finally, if the width, height and position of the strippingpeak(s) are the same as the peak(s) being stripped then the resultwill look like:<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/strip4.gif HEIGHT=151 Width=178><P>   This last case will result if there are no hidden peaks beneaththe peak in question. If no combination of height, width or positionwill remove a peak shaped object, then it very well may be anotherpeak. If the structure is small and is on the left side of a peak,it may also be the contribution of incomplete charge collection.If this is the case, the structure will not look quite like apeak because of its strong asymmetry.<P>In this version of the program, it is not possible to change thewidth or position of a reference peak. In a later release of DTSA,we will add in controlled amounts of the first and second derivativewhich will achieve this purpose over a limited range <H2 ALIGN=CENTER ><A NAME="EQ">EDS Detector QC</A></H2><P>   This is designed for tracking your detector parameters over long periods of time. For this, a spectrum should be collected from an easily available and stable material using your normal operating conditions. For the best results, the material should have x-ray peaks at both high and low energies and there should not be seriously overlapped peaks. <B>Collect the spectrum for enough time to insure good counting statistics.</B><P>Load the spectrum into WORK and select the QC Setup from the Analysis Menu as shown in the following figure.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/QC_Menu.gif HEIGHT=234 Width=365> <P>The QC Setup dialog will then appear.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/QC_Setup_D.gif HEIGHT=345 Width=507> <P>Select either the EPMA/SEM button or the AEM button. Enter the beam voltage, beam current and the acquisition live time in their appropriate boxes. Clicking the &quot;Set up Calibration&quot; button will bring up the <A HREF="Main_Control.html#CA"> Calibration Dialog</a>. Set up the energy calibration as described. Click the &quot;Select Peaks&quot; button. This brings up the setup for a <A href="Main_Control.html#SI"> Simplex</a> fit. Select the peaks you want to fit in your spectrum (these may include the peaks used for calibration). When everything is ready, click the &quot;Save Set-up&quot; button.<P>You may now run the QC procedure that you have saved by selecting the &quot;Run QC&quot; button from the File Menu. The following dialog appears.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC=../images/QC_Run_D.gif HEIGHT=314 Width=428> <P>Click the &quot;Select the Setup Procedure File&quot; and open the Setup procedure you have created in the previous steps. You may have as many of these files as you have detectors that you wish to monitor. Then select either &quot;Open an Old Spreadsheet File&quot; or &quot;Create a New Spreadsheet File&quot; depending on whether you are starting a new file for the results or adding the results to a previously created file. When everything is complete, click the OK button to run the procedure on the spectrum in work. The results will be entered on one line of the spreadsheet file. The EPMA/SEM results are the same as the AEM results except that the fit for beam voltage is not done for the AEM. The results consist of the fitted beam voltage (for the EPMA/SEM), the slope and intercept for the energy calibration, and the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM), energy and area for each fitted peak. <P>Continue by collecting a spectrum of the same material at a later date (weekly/monthly) and running the same QC procedure on it. The results will be appended to the results spreadsheet. After a period of time, you will be able to plot any of the different parameters in the spreadsheet. In this manner, you will be able to track your detector performance and possibly locate problems before they become serious.<P><A HREF="#top">Top</A><P><A HREF="../DTSA_Manual.html">Table of Contents</A><P></BODY></HTML>
